                                    <p><strong>Dear Students!</strong> Welcome to Late  Bapusaheb Patil Ekambekar Gramin College, Hanegaon Tq.Degloor Dist.Nanded. It is  an institution of academic excellence and achievement, was established in 1997. It is amongst one of the finest colleges within the SRTMU. At our College, we are imparting higher education to young students in India, which is a very substantial, potent. We all know that student are a great human resource and the role of student in the society is critical for development of a nation. </p>
                                    <p>I want that our students should be imparted an all round education so that they become multidimensional rather than uni-dimensional. In my view, acquiring information is no longer the main focus of education; instead the main aim of education is to build the powers of human mind and spirit. We believe in providing our students an environment, rich in knowledge and supportive for their extra curricular interests. We aim to evaluate our students on the basis of their physical, mental, social, emotional and intellectual development.</p>
                                    <p>Our college is committed to maintaining an academically rich and professionally competent environment by encouraging the enterprising skills of our students. Our faculty members do support and play a vital role in the overall development of our students and the institute. </p>
                                        <p>I welcome you all to this great institution of higher learning and assure you of a nurturing and caring environment that will see all of you blossom into empowered and sensitive human beings. </p>
